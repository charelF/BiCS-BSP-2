This folder contains a some neural networks.

keras_basisCNN and kerasCNN are the same as the Udemy CNNs from the beginning. They are not ready to work and were
use to experiment on simplyfying the code.

tensorflowCNN and tensorflowCNN-2 are CNNS which were downloaded from https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/layers
and while they should work, they do not, or at least not as expected.

02_Convolutinoal ..... are another NN. It comes from this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMcx-zY8JSg
which linked to this repo: https://github.com/Hvass-Labs/TensorFlow-Tutorials/blob/master/02_Convolutional_Neural_Network.ipynb
This provides us an Ipython Notebook. We then used jupyter/Ipython to upload this notebook and download is as a .py file.
When we ran it (using anaconda - bsp2ml as virtual env - spyder as IDE), EVERYTHIN WORKED AS EXPECTED.
