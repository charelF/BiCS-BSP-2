Features to be added. 
PRO keyword designates interesting but probably hard to implement idea.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

- add more types of noise:
	- PRO: sunrays (connected lines of 1s, like subvectors, from a central point)
	- PRO: blur (only apply noise around edges between submatrix and matrix, where 1's and 0's meet)
	- other shapes (have more noise shapes)

- add different types and shapes of submatrices to be detected

- PRO: add colorful (RGB) and grayscale (0.00-1.00 instead of 0 or 1) noise and submatrices
	- necessites change to NN to be able to detect these different entries.

- PRO: try to create the dataset functionality to save an exisiting image in the same form as our current datasets, ie in a text list
	- necessites above requirement of colorful or grayscale to be implemented
